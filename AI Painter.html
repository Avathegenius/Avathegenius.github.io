<p> These are the paintings that I made with 2 AI painters . The first one is guagan and the second one ois the dream one. The guagan one you have to draw the factors and stuff, however, for the dream one, you just describe what you want in the image and the style.&nbsp; &nbsp; After that, I drew on them a little by using photoshop. I made them related by both drawing Tom and Jerry(the cartoon) on them, however, the color might be a little different because I can't get the same color.&nbsp; In the first picture Tom has Jerry cornered and in the second picture Jerry is sliding down the hill and Tom is trying not to slide down the hill&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="Ava's Guagan picture please do not touch.png" width="512" height="512" alt=""><img src="Ava's Dream AI thing please do not touch.jpg" width="540" height="960" alt=""> </p>
