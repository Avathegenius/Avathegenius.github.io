<p>Fine here is what I like. I like to sleep. I am serious. And I like wasting people's time and annoying them and maddening them :) It just feels good. I also like reading but if it's some really boing book I will be giving up in the first chapter or even the first page. But if the first page is good I could read a lot of boring chapters because I'm like this will be good everything will be soon interesting. Or I can read a book that's really popular but for some reason isn't interesting at all. I managed to read the Hobbit this way because I heard it was really popular and a bunch of people liked it. But it was one of the most crappy and cheesy and boring&nbsp; books I've ever read. Which is sad because it wasted so much time that I could've spent on actual good books and right after reading it it made me kind of lose interest in books.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
