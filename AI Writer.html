<p>I think the contenet is very good but there's some grammatical mistakes since it's still not as good as stuff that people write since Chinese is hard and stuff. I typed that I wanted it in Chinese but I have a suspicion that the AI writer wrote in English and then translated it, or it's just really really bad at Chinese.</p>

<p>&nbsp;English:&nbsp;Exams are a standard part of education every student goes through. However, exams are flawed as a teaching tool. Firstly, most students have trouble studying for exams in the first place. Secondly, centralized exams create a stressful environment for students. Students also shouldn't have exams since it's not realistic to have exams for all subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exams are good for teaching if they're tailored to the subject and if students understand how to study. Students often have trouble studying for exams in the first place. If your students don't understand how to study, it's difficult for them to pass exams with high marks. It's also difficult for teachers to grade fairly if students are studying for multiple exams at once. Instead, teachers should work with students to help them understand how to study and effectively grasp the lessons being taught.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Centralized exams also create a stressful environment for students. Exams often take place within a limited timeframe and must be completed by a certain date. This forces teachers and students into narrow timeframes that don't allow for error or weakness. It's also unrealistic to expect all subjects to have standardized exams. Unless teachers focus extra time on each student, they'll fall behind in covering every subject material required by law. For example, consider an art teacher covering art, drama, dance, and music subjects in their syllabus. It's clearly not realistic to expect that teacher to cover all their subject materials via standardized examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, exams are flawed since they're schedule driven- which means they change from school year to school year. Exams are also stressful since each student must individually prepare for them. This is problematic since anyone can take any exam at any time without regard of their current knowledge or abilities. Essentially, exams are stressful because they're constantly changing and anyone can take them at any time- whereas everyone is studying for the same thing simultaneously. Instead of exams, schools should use assessments that gauge a student's current understanding of the curriculum material. Doing so would help teachers identify struggling students and design targeted lessons tailor-made for each student's needs and abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exams are a standard part of education but they're flawed as a teaching tool. Students don't study well if teachers aren't willing to help them understand how to study. Centralized exams also create a stressful environment for students that makes learning difficult. Exams also don't reflect real-world situations that require quick decision-making abilities and accountability. Instead of exams, schools could use assessments that gauge a student's current understanding of the curriculum material so instructors can more effectively teach students relevant lessons applicable to their current level of ability and knowledge acquisition/retention/re acquisition respectively/ as well as more effectively gauge student understanding of what they've been taught as well as give them an opportunity to practice skills before taking an exam so they can do better on it and show improvement in their relevant skillse s .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exams are good for teaching but they're flawed as a teaching tool since no one studies well under stress and they're stressful since anyone can take any exam at any time without regard of their current knowledge or abilities or focus on individual students instead of focusing on the entire class or classes together/. Schools should ditch the exam system in favor of assessment systems that help instructors more effectively gauge student understanding at any given time as well as more effectively target lessons towards individual student strengths and weaknesses/.</p>
<p>The content of this is also good, but there is a lot of repeating and it's basically saying the same thing over and over but with different ways, so if you read it for the second time it would be so boring</p>
